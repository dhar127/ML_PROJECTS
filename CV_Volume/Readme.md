# ✋ Hand Gesture Volume Control

Control your system volume using hand gestures via webcam using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and pycaw.

## 📸 Demo

Raise your hand in front of the webcam. Bringing your thumb and index finger closer or farther adjusts the system volume.

OpenCV & MediaPipe by Google

pycaw for Windows audio control

⚠️ Note
This script only works on Windows because pycaw is a Windows-specific audio control library.

For best results, ensure a well-lit environment so MediaPipe detects your hand landmarks accurately.
